# Process Synchronization in OS
  &nbsp;
Processes Synchronization or Synchronization is the way by which processes that share the same memory space are managed in an operating system. It helps maintain the consistency of data by using variables or hardware so that only one process can make changes to the shared memory at a time. There are various solutions for the same such as semaphores, mutex locks, synchronization hardware, etc.<br><br>

An operating system is a software that manages all applications on a device and basically helps in the smooth functioning of our computer. Because of this reason, the operating system has to perform many tasks, and sometimes simultaneously. This isn't usually a problem unless these simultaneously occurring processes use a common resource.
