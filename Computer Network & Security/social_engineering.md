# What is Social Engineering

Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victim’s trust and provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources. Typical social engineering intrusion scenarios include:

* An attacker creates an executable file that prompts a network user for their password, and then records whatever the user inputs. The attacker then emails the executable file to the user with the story that the user must double-click the file and log on to the network again to clear up some logon problems the organization has been experiencing that morning. After the user complies, the attacker now has access to their network credentials.

* An attacker contacts the help desk pretending to be a remote sales representative who needs assistance setting up remote access. Through a series of phone calls, the attacker obtains the name/address of the remote access server and login credentials, in addition to phone numbers for remote access and for accessing the organization's private phone and voice-mail system.

* An attacker triggers a fire alarm and then slips into the building during the confusion and attaches a monitoring device to a network port.

# Social Engineering Attack Techniques

Social engineering attacks come in many different forms and can be performed anywhere where human interaction is involved. The following are the five most common forms of digital social engineering assaults.

1. **Baiting**
    As its name implies, baiting attacks use a false promise to pique a victim’s greed or curiosity. They lure users into a trap that steals their personal information or inflicts their systems with malware.

2. **Scareware**
    Scareware involves victims being bombarded with false alarms and fictitious threats. Users are deceived to think their system is infected with malware, prompting them to install software that has no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator) or is malware itself. Scareware is also referred to as deception software, rogue scanner software and fraudware.

3. **Pretexting**
    Here an attacker obtains information through a series of cleverly crafted lies. The scam is often initiated by a perpetrator pretending to need sensitive information from a victim so as to perform a critical task. The attacker usually starts by establishing trust with their victim by impersonating co-workers, police, bank and tax officials, or other persons who have right-to-know authority. The pretexter asks questions that are ostensibly required to confirm the victim’s identity, through which they gather important personal data.
    
4. **Phishing**
    As one of the most popular social engineering attack types, phishing scams are email and text message campaigns aimed at creating a sense of urgency, curiosity or fear in victims. It then prods them into revealing sensitive information, clicking on links to malicious websites, or opening attachments that contain malware.
    
5. **Spear Phishing**
    This is a more targeted version of the phishing scam whereby an attacker chooses specific individuals or enterprises. They then tailor their messages based on characteristics, job positions, and contacts belonging to their victims to make their attack less conspicuous. Spear phishing requires much more effort on behalf of the perpetrator and may take weeks and months to pull off. They’re much harder to detect and have better success rates if done skillfully.
    
# Social Engineering Principles

To begin to adequately address this threat, you need to understand the four basic tactics or principles on which all social engineering attacks are based. Threat actors will seek to manipulate end-users into circumventing controls or inadvertently providing sensitive data by establishing and exploiting relationships of either: “Trust”, “Authority”, “Intimidation” or “Scarcity”. These are known as the four principles of social engineering and all attacks can be attributed to the use of one or more of their attributes. Understanding these attributes and training your staff on how to spot them is the key to thwarting them.

1. **Trust**
    The definition of trust is “the firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something”. Trusting someone or something provides a sense of surety, safety and security. But more importantly, when we place our trust in someone or something, we innately expect it to be returned in kind – not misused. Certainly not exploited for advantage. This is of course, exactly why attackers use it. Face value trust is the premise of most social engineering attacks. It’s inherent in phishing and spear phishing attacks.

2. **Authority**
The definition of authority is “the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience”. Having authority over someone is equal to having control over someone. A person of authority is a person of control and confidence. A “confidence man” or “con man”. We are raised to respect and comply with the authority and not question it. Disregarding authority implies punishment. This is basically like saying “do it because I have authority over you, and I say so or it may result in harm to you”. Therefore, it’s a perfect and powerful tool for manipulating someone. This is why social engineering attacks based on the premise of authority – like whaling – are so successful.

3. **Intimidation**
To intimidate means to “make timid, threaten or frighten someone to compel them to behave in a certain way”. This is a simple, straightforward, and effective strategy practiced by bullies in playgrounds across the world. Threat actors employ methods of intimidation to sway users into taking specific actions. Authority is implied but not necessary. It’s like saying “do this or something bad will happen to you”. Nobody wants anything bad to happen to them, so it naturally produces results. This can be accomplished through social engineering attacks based on continual harassment or impersonation like vishing or pretexting.

4. **Scarcity**
Finally, there is the social engineering tactic of “scarcity”. When something is in limited supply, there is a natural inclination by people to act quickly to obtain it before it’s no longer available to us. Accelerating their decision processing or bypassing common sense so as not to lose the opportunity. Foolish? Of course. But to imply scarcity is an extremely effective way to manipulate someone into doing something they normally would not do. Just ask the marketing industry who have learned the power of the words “act now while supplies last! Threat actors use this tactic to pressure victims to respond immediately lest they miss an opportunity in attacks like quid pro quo.

# Social Engineering Prevention

Social engineers manipulate human feelings, such as curiosity or fear, to carry out schemes and draw victims into their traps. Therefore, be wary whenever you feel alarmed by an email, attracted to an offer displayed on a website, or when you come across stray digital media lying about. Being alert can help you protect yourself against most social engineering attacks taking place in the digital realm. Moreover, the following tips can help improve your vigilance in relation to social engineering hacks.

* **Don’t open emails and attachments from suspicious sources** – If you don’t know the sender in question, you don’t need to answer an email. Even if you do know them and are suspicious about their message, cross-check and confirm the news from other sources, such as via telephone or directly from a service provider’s site. Remember that email addresses are spoofed all of the time; even an email purportedly coming from a trusted source may have actually been initiated by an attacker.

* **Use multifactor authentication** – One of the most valuable pieces of information attackers seek are user credentials. Using multifactor authentication helps ensure your account’s protection in the event of system compromise. Imperva Login Protect is an easy-to-deploy 2FA solution that can increase account security for your applications.

* **Be wary of tempting offers** – If an offer sounds too enticing, think twice before accepting it as fact. Googling the topic can help you quickly determine whether you’re dealing with a legitimate offer or a trap.

* **Keep your antivirus/antimalware software updated** – Make sure automatic updates are engaged, or make it a habit to download the latest signatures first thing each day. Periodically check to make sure that the updates have been applied, and scan your system for possible infections.
