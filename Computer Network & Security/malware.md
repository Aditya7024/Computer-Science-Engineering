# What's Malware

Malware, short for “malicious software,” refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called “hackers”) to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Examples of common malware include viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Recent malware attacks have exfiltrated data in mass amounts.

# Types of Malware

There are many types of malware, but they are not classified in a rigorous way, so some definitions overlap or are blurred. Some malware classifications, such as Trojan, virus, and worm, focus on the vector used by the malware. The vector is the method by which the malware executes on a computer and potentially spreads to other network hosts. Another complicating factor with malware classification is the degree to which its installation is expected or tolerated by the user.

| Types | Explanation |
| - | - | 
| Virus | Viruses are a subgroup of malware. A virus is malicious software attached to a document or file that supports macros to execute its code and spread from host to host. Once downloaded, the virus will lay dormant until the file is opened and in use. Viruses are designed to disrupt a system’s ability to operate. As a result, viruses can cause significant operational issues and data loss. |
| Worms | Worms are a malicious software that rapidly replicates and spreads to any device within the network. Unlike viruses, worms do not need host programs to disseminate. A worm infects a device via a downloaded file or a network connection before it multiplies and disperses at an exponential rate. Like viruses, worms can severely disrupt the operations of a device and cause data loss. |
| Trojan virus | Trojan viruses are disguised as helpful software programs. But once the user downloads it, the Trojan virus can gain access to sensitive data and then modify, block, or delete the data. This can be extremely harmful to the performance of the device. Unlike normal viruses and worms, Trojan viruses are not designed to self-replicate. |
| Spyware | Spyware is malicious software that runs secretly on a computer and reports back to a remote user. Rather than simply disrupting a device’s operations, spyware targets sensitive information and can grant remote access to predators. Spyware is often used to steal financial or personal information. A specific type of spyware is a keylogger, which records your keystrokes to reveal passwords and personal information. |
| Adware | Adware is malicious software used to collect data on your computer usage and provide appropriate advertisements to you. While adware is not always dangerous, in some cases adware can cause issues for your system. Adware can redirect your browser to unsafe sites, and it can even contain Trojan horses and spyware. Additionally, significant levels of adware can slow down your system noticeably. Because not all adware is malicious, it is important to have protection that constantly and intelligently scans these programs. |
| Ransomware | Ransomware is malicious software that gains access to sensitive information within a system, encrypts that information so that the user cannot access it, and then demands a financial payout for the data to be released. Ransomware is commonly part of a phishing scam. By clicking a disguised link, the user downloads the ransomware. The attacker proceeds to encrypt specific information that can only be opened by a mathematical key they know. When the attacker receives payment, the data is unlocked. |
| Fileless malware | Fileless malware is a type of memory-resident malware. As the term suggests, it is malware that operates from a victim’s computer’s memory, not from files on the hard drive. Because there are no files to scan, it is harder to detect than traditional malware. It also makes forensics more difficult because the malware disappears when the victim computer is rebooted. In late 2017, the Cisco Talos threat intelligence team posted an example of fileless malware that they called DNSMessenger. |

# Why do cybercriminals use malware?

Malware encompasses all types of malicious software, including viruses, and cybercriminals use it for many reasons, such as:

* Tricking a victim into providing personal data for identity theft
* Stealing consumer credit card data or other financial data
* Assuming control of multiple computers to launch denial-of-service attacks against other networks
* Infecting computers and using them to mine bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies

# Malware Indicators

Given the range of malware types, there are many potential indicators. Some types of malware display obvious changes, such as adjusting browser settings or displaying ransom notices. If malware is designed to operate covertly, indicators can require detailed analysis of process, file system, and network behavior.

1. Antivirus Notifications

    Most hosts should be running some type of antivirus (A-V) software. While the A-V moniker remains popular, these suites are better conceived of as endpoint protection platforms (EPPs) or next-gen A-V. These detect malware by signature regardless of type, though detection rates can vary quite widely from product to product. Many suites also integrate with user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) and use AI-backed analysis to detect threat actor behavior that has bypassed malware signature matching.

2. Sandbox Execution

    If it is not detected by endpoint protection, you may want to analyze the suspect code in a sandboxed environment. A sandbox is a system configured to be completely isolated from its host so that the malware cannot "break out." The sandbox will be designed to record file system and registry changes plus network activity. [Cuckoo](cuckoosandbox.org) is packaged software that aims to provide a turnkey sandbox solution.

3. Resource Consumption

    Abnormal resource consumption can be detected using a performance monitor, Task Manager, or the top Linux utility. Indicators such as excessive and continuous CPU usage, memory leaks, disk read/write activity, and disk space usage can be signs of malware, but can also be caused by many other performance and system stability issues. Also, it is only really poorly written malware or malware that performs intensive operations (botnet DDoS, cryptojacking, and cryptoransomware, for instance) that displays this behavior. Resource consumption could be a reason to investigate a system rather than definitive proof of infection.

4. File System

    While fileless malware is certainly prevalent, file system change or anomaly analysis is still necessary. Even if the malware code is not saved to disk, the
malware is still likely to interact with the file system and registry, revealing its presence by behavior. A computer's file system stores a great deal of useful metadata about when files were created, accessed, or modified. Analyzing these metadata and checking for suspicious temporary files can help you establish your timeline of events for an incident that has left traces on a host and its files.

# What is the characteristics whether a computer is compromised by malware or not?

The most common signs that your computer has been compromised by malware are:

* Slow computer performance 
* Browser redirects, or when your web browser takes you to sites you did not intend to visit 
* Infection warnings, frequently accompanied by solicitations to buy something to fix them
* Problems shutting down or starting up your computer
* Frequent pop-up ads

The more of these common symptoms you see, the higher the likelihood your computer has a malware infection. Browser redirects and large numbers of pop-up warnings claiming you have a virus are the strongest indicators that your computer has been compromised.

# What is Malware Protection?

Malware security protection provides that second vital layer of protection for your computer or network. A robust antivirus software package is the primary component of technological defenses that every personal and business computer system should have. Well-designed antivirus protection has several characteristics. It checks any newly downloaded program to ensure that it is malware-free. It periodically scans the computer to detect and defeat any malware that might have slipped through. It is regularly updated to recognize the latest threats.

Good antivirus protection can also recognize — and warn against — even previously unknown malware threats, based on technical features (such as attempting to "hide" on a computer) that are characteristic of malware. In addition, robust antivirus software detects and warns against suspicious websites, especially those that may be designed for "phishing" (a technique that tricks users into entering passwords or account numbers).

Finally, malware protection needs to be usable. Effective antivirus software must be simple to download and install, so you don't need to be a Ph.D. in computer science in order to use it. Look for antivirus software solutions that have the characteristics outlined above — and follow through by installing it.

Robust malware protection specifically guards your finances. These tools safeguard your account information, and can also provide password-management tools so that frustration over forgotten passwords does not lead you to skip over this essential component of protection. No protection is absolute. But a combination of personal awareness and well-designed protective tools will make your computer as safe as it can be.
