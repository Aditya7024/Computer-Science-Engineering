## CircleCI ##

CircleCI is the continuous integration & delivery platform that helps the development teams to release code rapidly and automate the build, test, and deploy. 
CircleCI can be configured to run very complex pipelines efficiently with caching, docker layer caching, resource classes and many more. 
After repositories on GitHub or Bitbucket are authorized and added as a project to circleci.com, every code triggers CircleCI runs jobs. 
CircleCI also sends an email notification of success or failure after the tests complete.

CircleCI is used for building, testing, and deploying a project, by using automation. 
This automation takes place in pipelines with jobs.


These jobs include: 

A pipeline is a set of instructions or steps that our CI tool will execute each time our code is updated.
Jobs are a set of specific tasks for the building, testing and deploying stages. Each job is executed in a separate container or virtual machine.
