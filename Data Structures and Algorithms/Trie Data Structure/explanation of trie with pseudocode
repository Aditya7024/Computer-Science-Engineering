1. It is also known as Prefix tree.
2.It's also a tree which stores a set of strings.
3.Each node of trie stores an info of char.
4. It's a tree such that every traversal from root to any of the leaf is going to represent onw of word from the set of words.




Begin
function insert() :
   If key not present, inserts key into trie. If the key is prefix of trie node, just mark leaf node.
End
Begin
function deleteNode()
   If tree is empty then return null.
   If last character of the key is being processed,
      then that node will be no more end of string after deleting it.
      If given key is not prefix of any other string, then delete it and set root = NULL.
   If key is not the last character,
      Then recur for the child which will be obtained by using ASCII value.
   If root does not have any child left and it is not end of another word,
      Then delete it and set root = NULL.
End
